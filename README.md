Triumph Tree addresses the common issue faced by users in tracking and achieving their goals. Most goal-tracking apps lack a visually tangible way for users to observe their progress. Our solution introduces an in-app sprite that visibly grows alongside users as they accomplish their goals, providing a clear and satisfying representation of their progress.

In Triumph Tree, users can define their goals and track their progress over time, ensuring they stay on the path to success. The in-app sprite provides a visual representation of their journey, making their progress clear and engaging. 

Triumph Tree is useful, as it revolutionizes the way individuals track and follow their objectives, making goal achievement more engaging and motivating. Additionally, Triumph Tree assists users in staying motivated; by witnessing their accomplishments in real-time, users are more likely to stay committed to their goals, reducing the risk of goal abandonment.
